I am 29 years old, I am a Physicist and Systems Analyst, with some specializations but looking to obtain a Master in Physics and Astronomy. Since I was 10 years old I got in touch with HTML, having really learned about the subject at the age of 14 and at 16 I built at least four websites at the Federal University of Paran√° and I specialized in CSS. At the age of 18 I learned PHP and MySQL. I worked in a development company for a short time because of approval to be a public server in the field of Physics. Unfortunately over the years, much of my work has been erased because it has become a legacy, however now, 9 years later, I am updating myself, I am studying the source codes to create new projects and solutions.


### Front / Back Programmer since childhood

Born in times when NVU was my best friend, I grew up and worked as a developer, mainly FrontEnd, however, life separated me from this project from a very cool career that before considered only a ‚ú®hobby‚ú®;

For years I performed several other tasks and jobs, which made my PHP5.3 / 7.0 codes become a ‚ö°legacy üòÑ and become the reason for the desire for a professional renewal and relearning;

üå± Today I work in the development of solutions in PHP7.4 and JavaScript using MariaDB / MySQL databases;

Linux user ‚ù§, my main development tools for Apache2 / NodeJS are Gedit, Visual Studio Code, GitKraken, FileZilla and Shell Terminal üíª;

Study on PHP8, Frameworks / Libraries (Laravel, Angular, NodeJS, React, NextJS), NoSQL databases (Mongodb) and Mobile Applications (Ionic and ReactNative).

### ... Not just IT

üî≠ I still have Physics training and because of the academic environment üë®, I work as a researcher ü§î in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAstrophysics and Cosmology, studying Machine Learning applications and other advantages of the Python language at the same time that I perform N-Body Simulations.
