### About me

![image](https://media.giphy.com/media/i2rNOf3b7vJgk/source.gif)

Hello... I hope you are well.

I'm from Curitiba, I'm 33 years old and I have a master's degree in Physics and I'm specializing in Applied Artificial Intelligence. I once tried to get a PhD in Physics, but due to different experiences, I think I am satisfied with my level of education.

My master's degree was in extragalactic astrophysics where, through numerical n-body simulations, I studied the merger/formation processes of galaxy clusters and for this I used two Brazilian supercomputers (one at USP, the University of S√£o Paulo and another at LNCC, the Santos Dumont Supercomputer) and analyzed the data using different techniques and also using machine learning such as Gaussian Mixtures (GMM) and K-means.

I have a degree in physics (full degree and bachelor's degree) and in systems analysis and development where I have a specialization in Information Technology and Astronomy Teaching.

... I think I want a break from Physics.

Born at a time when NVU (and sometimes MS FrontEnd) was my best friend, I grew up and worked as a developer, but life separated me from this really cool career project that I previously considered just a ‚ú®hobby‚ú®.

üå± At some point in my life I programmed in C/C++, C#, Fortran, PHP (with or without Laravel/Blade), Python, R, Flutter and Java. I also play with MongoDB and MySQL databases. I also know a few things about Shell Script, CSS, HTML, Jquery (RIP), JS, Angular (RIP), AngularJs, Figma and REST API.

I'm a Linux user (mostly Ubuntu), but recently I'm using Windows 11 (because it's the default on my laptop üíª and well, it's a Samsung Book3 360 ‚ù§).

Sometimes I venture into Arduino projects and I have even worked as a Physics, Programming and Robotics teacher in high school for the State Department of Education of the Government of Paran√°.

On this Github I will create some basic projects or ones that I find different or attractive.

...Until later!
