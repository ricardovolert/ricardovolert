### About me

Hello... I hope you are well.

I'm 33 years old, I'm a PhD candidate in Physics and I'm specializing in Applied Artificial Intelligence. I have a degree in physics (full degree) and a technologist in systems analysis and development who lives in Curitiba.

Born at a time when NVU (and sometimes MS FrontEnd) was my best friend, I grew up and worked as a developer, but life separated me from this project of a very cool career that I previously considered just a ‚ú®hobby‚ú®.

üå± At some point in my life I have programmed in C/C++, C#, Fortran, PHP (with or without Laravel/Blade), Python, R, Flutter and Java. I also play with MongoDB and MySQL databases. I also know a few things about Shell Script, CSS, HTML, Jquery (RIP), JS, Angular (RIP), AngularJs, Figma and REST API.

I'm a Linux user (mostly Ubuntu), but recently I'm using Windows 11 (because it's the default on my laptop üíª and well, it's a Samsung Book3 360 ‚ù§).

Sometimes I venture into Arduino and ESP32 projects, I've even worked as a Physics, Programming and Robotics teacher in a high school.

Well, for years I carried out several other tasks and works, which made my main codes in PHP5.3/7.0 become a‚ö°legacy üòÑ and became a reason for the desire for professional renewal and relearning. As I'm lazy, I'm refactoring my Github and will create new projects as I progress in my studies once again. This means that I will program using fewer programming languages.

My master's degree was in extragalactic astrophysics where, through numerical n-body simulations, I studied the merger/formation processes of galaxy clusters and for this I used two Brazilian supercomputers (one at USP, the University of S√£o Paulo and another at LNCC, the Santos Dumont Supercomputer) and analyzed the data using different techniques and also using machine learning such as Gaussian Mixtures (GMM) and K-means.

Now, during my doctorate, I am carrying out work related to experimental physics with a focus on Condensed Matter Physics, specifically on the magnetic properties of thin films and spintronics, for this I will use various equipment such as lasers, X-ray diffractometers, Raman spectroscopy, etc., and I will also use DFT (Density Functional Theory) simulations.

I consider myself a theoretical, experimental and computational physicist, but in constant training. This Github of mine will be used to add codes that I find interesting, be it Physics or just scripts for development projects. I hope that the repositories here end up having teaching materials that I will prepare for my website (study notebook = ![Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/view/ricardovolert/)). I have an ambitious project to create updated textbooks for the subjects I studied in college (and which are normally canonical) and, over time, extend them to the exact science subjects I know. So I hope there is a lot of LaTeX code here.

Well, that's it... I'm sorry for taking up your time so far, and I hope there are useful projects when you look at my profile (if not, I'm probably busy solving lists of classical electrodynamics or quantum mechanics exercises, or else I'm writing something from doctorate degree).

Oh, don't be scared by my description above. I can be a bit dull, whether I listen to heavy metal or not, in addition, I can have a dubious or sarcastic sense of humor, but mainly, I may not be as smart as my training says I am, as my tastes fluctuate according to the time and not everything that I study I record. At the end of the day, I'm a good person and if I'm single and you are too, well, come along, woman!

... See you later!
