### About me

![image](https://media.giphy.com/media/i2rNOf3b7vJgk/source.gif)

I am 33 years old, I am a Physicist (full degree and master's degree) and Systems Analyst, with some specializations in Teaching Astronomy and also in Information Technology. During my master's degree, I analyzed the process of formation of galaxy clusters through numerical simulations.

Now, I'm starting my PhD in Physics in a new area. I am taking my first steps towards becoming an Experimental Physicist, where I will study Magnetic Films and Nanostructures.

Furthermore, I am studying a specialization in Applied Artificial Intelligence, as my training ends up being integrated and will be well used during the doctorate.

#### About my developer routine, it's not big or beautiful, but it was really cool.

Since the age of 10 I have had contact with HTML, having learned a lot about the subject at the age of 14 and at the age of 16 I built at least four websites at the Federal University of Paran√° and specialized in CSS. At 18 I learned PHP and MySQL. I worked in a development company for a short time due to being approved to be a public servant in the Physics area. Unfortunately, over the years, a lot of my work was erased because it became a legacy, but now, 9 years later, I'm updating myself, I'm studying the source codes to create new projects and solutions. In 2023, I worked as a Robotics, Programming and Physics teacher for high school at a Public School in Curitiba, in the State of Paran√°. 

### Front / Back Programmer since childhood

Born in times when NVU was my best friend, I grew up and worked as a developer, mainly FrontEnd, however, life separated me from this project from a very cool career that before considered only a ‚ú®hobby‚ú®;

For years I performed several other tasks and jobs, which made my PHP5.3 / 7.0 codes become a ‚ö°legacy üòÑ and become the reason for the desire for a professional renewal and relearning;

Linux user ‚ù§ but üíª recently I am returning to using Windows again;

üå± I have used Fortran, C, C++, C#, Java, PHP several times, however, since 2018, I have been in a close relationship with Python and C; 

### ... Not just IT

üî≠ I still have a degree in Physics and because of the academic environment üë®, one day I aspire to be a good researcher ü§î as an experimental physicist and computational physicist.
