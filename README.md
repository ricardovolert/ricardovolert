### About me

Hi... I hope you're doing well?

I'm 33 years old and I'm a PhD student in Physics and I'm studying a specialization in Applied Artificial Intelligence. I have a degree in physics (full degree) and a technologist in systems analysis and development who lives in Curitiba.

Born in times when NVU was my best friend, I grew up and worked as a developer, mainly MS FrontEnd, however, life separated me from this project from a very cool career that before considered only a ‚ú®hobby‚ú®.

üå± I program in C/C++, Fortran, PHP, Python, R, Flutter and Java. I also play with MongoDB and MySQL databases. I also know a thing or two about CSS, HTML, JS and REST API.

Linux (Ubuntu) user ‚ù§ but üíª recently I am using Windows 11 (because it is the default on my laptop)‚ö°.

Sometimes I venture into Arduino and ESP32 projects, I've even worked as a Physics, Programming and Robotics teacher for a High School.

For years I performed several other tasks and jobs, which made my PHP5.3 / 7.0 codes become a ‚ö°legacy üòÑ and become the reason for the desire for a professional renewal and relearning. So I'm refactoring my repositories on Github and will create new projects as I go.

My master's degree was in extragalactic astrophysics where, through n-body simulations, I studied the merger/formation processes of galaxy clusters and for this I used two supercomputers (one at USP, the University of S√£o Paulo and another at LNCC, the Santos Supercomputer Dumont) and analyzed the data using different techniques and also using machine learning with GMM and K-means.

Now, during my doctorate, I carried out work related to experimental physics focusing on Condensed Matter Physics, specifically on the magnetic properties of thin films and spintronics, for this I will use various equipment such as lasers, X-ray diffractometers, Raman spectroscopy, etc., and I will also use DFT (Functional Density Theory) simulations.

I consider myself a theoretical, experimental and computational physicist, but in constant training. This repository will be for adding codes that you find interesting, whether in Physics or just scripts for dev projects.

Well, that's it... I'm sorry for taking up your time so far and I hope there are useful projects when you look at my profile (if not, I'm probably busy solving lists of exercises in classical electrodynamics or quantum mechanics, or else I'm writing something from the doctorate).

... until later!
