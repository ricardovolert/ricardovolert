### Front / Back Programmer since childhood

Born in times when NVU was my best friend, I grew up and worked as a developer, mainly FrontEnd, however, life separated me from this project from a very cool career that before considered only a ✨hobby✨;

For years I performed several other tasks and jobs, which made my PHP5.3 / 7.0 codes become a ⚡legacy 😄 and become the reason for the desire for a professional renewal and relearning;

🌱 Today I work in the development of solutions in PHP7.4 and JavaScript using MariaDB / MySQL databases;

Linux user, my main development tools for Apache2 / NodeJS are Gedit, Visual Studio Code, GitKraken, FileZilla and Shell Terminal;

Study on PHP8, Frameworks / Libraries (Laravel, Angular, NodeJS, React, NextJS), NoSQL databases (Mongodb) and Mobile Applications (Ionic and ReactNative).

### ... Not just IT

🔭 I still have Physics training and because of the academic environment, I work as a researcher 🤔 in the area of ​​Astrophysics and Cosmology, studying Machine Learning applications and other advantages of the Python language at the same time that I perform N-Body Simulations.
